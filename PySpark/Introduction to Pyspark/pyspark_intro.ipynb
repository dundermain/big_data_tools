    "The first step in using Spark is connecting to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the cluster will be hosted on a remote machine that's connected to all other nodes. There will be one computer, called the master that manages splitting up the data and the computations. The master is connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called worker. The master sends the workers data and calculations to run, and they send their results back to the master.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're just getting started with Spark it's simpler to just run a cluster locally. Thus, for this course, instead of connecting to another computer, all computations will be run on DataCamp's servers in a simulated cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the connection is as simple as creating an instance of the SparkContext class. The class constructor takes a few optional arguments that allow you to specify the attributes of the cluster you're connecting to.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object holding all these attributes can be created with the SparkConf() constructor. Take a look at the documentation for all the details!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this course you'll have a SparkContext called sc already available in your workspace\n",

    "# Using DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark's core data structure is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). This is a low level object that lets Spark work its magic by splitting data across multiple nodes in the cluster. However, RDDs are hard to work with directly, so in this course you'll be using the Spark DataFrame abstraction built on top of RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark DataFrame was designed to behave a lot like a SQL table (a table with variables in the columns and observations in the rows). Not only are they easier to understand, DataFrames are also more optimized for complicated operations than RDDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start modifying and combining columns and rows of data, there are many ways to arrive at the same result, but some often take much longer than others. When using RDDs, it's up to the data scientist to figure out the right way to optimize the query, but the DataFrame implementation has much of this optimization built in!\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with Spark DataFrames, you first have to create a SparkSession object from your SparkContext. You can think of the SparkContext as your connection to the cluster and the SparkSession as your interface with that connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, for the rest of this course you'll have a SparkSession called spark available in your workspace!"
